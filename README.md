# unit-2-project
Lambda school project where we had to use predictive modeling on a data set of our choice. 
I choose the popular Esport game League Of legends. My dataset used was on the 2018 world championship.
I initially wanted to predict the winner of the match before the game started however realized that it was not possible.
Instead what ended up happening was using I made a model to predict the winner based on what happened during the game.
From there I dove deeper into what events happened in the game that correlated to a higher winning chance. I don't have access to
a live game data feed but if I did I could see evolving this project into a real-time winner predictor based on the events that
have occurred so far in-game.
